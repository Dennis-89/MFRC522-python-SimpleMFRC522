!Caution! Do not use, the code is under development
====================================================

Original code from [pimylifeup](https://github.com/YudiNz/MFRC522-python-SimpleMFRC522).
`RPi.GPIO` don't support the Raspberry Pi 5. In this fork I refactored the code to support also the Raspberry Pi 5.


Original ReadMe-Description:
-----------------------------

# mfrc522

A python library to read/write RFID tags via the budget MFRC522 RFID module.

This code was published in relation to a [blog post](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-rfid-rc522/) and you can find out more about how to hook up your MFRC reader to a Raspberry Pi there.

## Installation

Until the package is on PyPi, clone this repository and run `python setup.py install` in the top level directory.

## Example Code

The following code will read a tag from the MFRC522

```python
from time import sleep
import sys
from mfrc522 import SimpleMFRC522
reader = SimpleMFRC522()

try:
    while True:
        print("Hold a tag near the reader")
        id, text = reader.read()
        print("ID: %s\nText: %s" % (id,text))
        sleep(5)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    GPIO.cleanup()
    raise
```
